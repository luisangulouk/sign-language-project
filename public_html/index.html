	    			<h2>Wikipedia definition:</h2>
		    		<p>A sign language (also signed language) is a language which chiefly uses manual communication to convey meaning, as opposed to acoustically 
		    			conveyed sound patterns. This can involve simultaneously combining hand shapes, orientation and movement of the hands, arms or body, and 
		    			facial expressions to express a speaker's thoughts. Sign languages share many similarities with spoken languages (sometimes called "oral languages", 
		    			which depend primarily on sound), which is why linguists consider both to be natural languages. Although there are also some significant differences 
		    			between signed and spoken languages, such as how they use space grammatically, sign languages show the same linguistic properties and use the 
		    			same language faculty as do spoken languages.They should not be confused with body language, which is a kind of non-linguistic communication.
		    		</p>
		    		<p>
						Wherever communities of deaf people exist, sign languages have developed, and are at the cores of local deaf cultures. Although signing is used 
						primarily by the deaf, it is also used by others, such as people who can hear, but cannot physically speak.
		    		</p>
		
					<p>It is not clear how many sign languages there are. A common misconception is that all sign languages are the same worldwide or that sign language 
						is international. Aside from the pidgin International Sign, each country generally has its own, native sign language, and some have more than one 
						(although there are also substantial similarities among all sign languages). The 2013 edition of Ethnologue lists 137 sign languages. Some 
						sign languages have obtained some form of legal recognition, while others have no status at all.

			    		<p>My name is <span>Russell Aldersson</span> and I am a teacher at the City Literary Institute in Central London.  After many years working as a BSL/English 
			    			interpreter I began a shift into the education sector and now focus primarily on the teaching of English and Maths to Deaf adults. 
			    			I hold a Postgraduate Certificate in Teaching and Learning in Higher Education, a Diploma in Teaching in the Lifelong Sector, Qualified 
			    			Teacher Status (Secondary Education), CELTA (Cambridge certificate in English Language Teaching to Adults), MA (Applied Linguistics), 
			    			MA (Language Teaching) and I am currently working towards my EdD (Doctorate in Education).

							This website was developed after I identified a need for Deaf learners of English, who have a signed language as a first or preferred language, 
							to have a resource where grammatical concepts can be explained in a medium that is easier to understand and more accessible. Whilst developed 
							initially to support my own students and those of my colleagues at the City Lit, this site and the resources available are for anyone who feels 
							they can benefit from the content. There is a long way to go and this is just the beginning and I hope to expand and develop the site moving 
							forward.  Your feedback, positive and constructive, is warmly welcomed.
